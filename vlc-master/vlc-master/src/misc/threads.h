 * Queued mutex
 *
 * A queued mutex is a type of thread-safe mutual exclusion lock that is
 * acquired in strict FIFO order.
 *
 * In most cases, a regular mutex (\ref vlc_mutex_t) should be used instead.
 * There are important differences:
 * - A queued mutex is generally slower, especially on the fast path.
 * - A queued mutex cannot be combined with a condition variable.
 *   Indeed, the scheduling policy of the condition variable would typically
 *   conflict with that of the queued mutex, leading to a dead lock.
 * - The try-lock operation is not implemented.
