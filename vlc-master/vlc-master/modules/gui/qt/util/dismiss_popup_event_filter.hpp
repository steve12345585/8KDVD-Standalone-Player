/**
 * @internal
 *
 * The DismissPopupEventFilter class monitors mouse button press events and
 * when needed dismisses the active popup widget.
 *
 * plasmashell uses both QtQuick and QtWidgets under a single roof, QtQuick is
 * used for most of things, while QtWidgets is used for things such as context
 * menus, etc.
 *
 * If user clicks outside a popup window, it's expected that the popup window
 * will be closed.  On X11, it's achieved by establishing both a keyboard grab
 * and a pointer grab. But on Wayland, you can't grab keyboard or pointer. If
 * user clicks a surface of another app, the compositor will dismiss the popup
 * surface.  However, if user clicks some surface of the same application, the
 * popup surface won't be dismissed, it's up to the application to decide
 * whether the popup must be closed. In 99% cases, it must.
 *
 * Qt has some code that dismisses the active popup widget if another window
 * of the same app has been clicked. But, that code works only if the
 * application uses solely Qt widgets. See QTBUG-83972. For plasma it doesn't
 * work, because as we said previously, it uses both Qt Quick and Qt Widgets.
 *
 * Ideally, this bug needs to be fixed upstream, but given that it'll involve
 * major changes in Qt, the chances of it being fixed any time soon are slim.
 *
 * In order to work around the popup dismissal bug, we install an event filter
 * that monitors Qt::MouseButtonPress events. If it happens that user has
 * clicked outside an active popup widget, that popup will be closed. This
 * event filter is not needed on X11!
