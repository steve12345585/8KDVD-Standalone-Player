- **Q87**: ‚úÖ Display Resolution Scaling: Supports native resolutions from standard television (384√ó280 NTSC) to doubled-resolution modes (768√ó560), UCM accommodates varying physical modes by adjusting internal scaling coefficients (Sx, Sy), CD-RTOS graphics library recalculates UCM transformation matrix on video mode transitions, coordinate invariance ensures graphical object at UCM coordinate (500, 500) maps precisely to expected physical pixel location, high-resolution modes require VSC to process up to four times pixel data
- **Q88**: ‚úÖ Sub-Pixel Positioning: Coordinates computed with high internal precision using fixed-point or floating-point arithmetic, final sub-pixel accuracy resolution into blended color values delegated to VSC hardware, VSC performs necessary interpolation (bilinear filtering) during line-by-line rendering process, enables smooth visual transitions and high-fidelity edge localization, computational efficiency by capitalizing on VSC's pixel data manipulation capabilities

### **AVCHD FORMAT - CONSUMER DETAILS** ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**

#### **16. BDMV Structure Variations** ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**
- **Q96**: ‚úÖ AVCHD vs Blu-ray BDMV: AVCHD is highly constrained subset of Blu-ray BDMV, designed for diverse consumer storage media (HDD, DVD, solid-state cards) vs Blu-ray's high-capacity optical media focus, dependent on common PC file systems (FAT32/exFAT) vs professional Blu-ray's UDF variants, AVCHD Progressive modes (1080p50/60) exceed original mandatory Blu-ray specification constraints, simplified directory structure omitting complex features like BD-J interactivity, prioritizes quick camera-to-disc/PC transfer and playback over sophisticated authored Blu-ray titles
- **Q97**: ‚úÖ Simplified File Extensions: Hierarchical file system under root directory path \PRIVATE\AVCHD\BDMV, .MTS/.m2ts (raw stream files in MPEG Transport Stream container, located in \BDMV\STREAM directory, hold compressed H.264 video and Dolby Digital audio payloads), .CPI (Clip Information file in \BDMV\CLIPINF folder, stores temporal indexing metadata, clock references, and entry points crucial for mapping timecode to physical byte locations within corresponding .MTS file), .MPL (Playlist file in \BDMV\PLAYLIST, defines logical playback sequence by chaining clips and stores explicit user-defined chapter markers), layered metadata-dependent structure means raw .MTS files not designed for isolated use
- **Q98**: ‚úÖ Navigation System: Relies on crucial external index file Clip Information (.CPI) associated one-to-one with corresponding .MTS stream file, complexity of seeking in H.264 stream (P-frames/B-frames referencing I-frames) necessitates external index for efficiency, .CPI file stores Entry Point Map (EPM) explicitly mapping Presentation Time Stamps (PTS) to physical offsets within .MTS file where crucial I-frames are located, seeking process: consult .CPI file ‚Üí use EPM to identify closest preceding I-frame offset ‚Üí perform direct file system seek to physical byte offset ‚Üí begin decoding at I-frame and process subsequent P/B-frames until target PTS reached, external indexing explains challenges when raw .MTS files manually copied without accompanying .CPI metadata
- **Q99**: ‚úÖ Storage Media Detection: Handles media detection purely through file system recognition, compliant playback devices/camcorders/editing software do not rely on dedicated hardware signature on storage medium, detection process involves scanning root of connected drive (SD card, HDD, DVD) for specific folder path \PRIVATE\AVCHD\BDMV, presence and integrity of this structure signals AVCHD content, rigid uniform folder hierarchy regardless of physical storage format ensures format portability and ease of handling across disparate platforms (Windows, Mac, dedicated players), if entire folder structure copied correctly from camera card to hard drive, editing software can recognize BDMV container as single cohesive clip
- **Q100**: ‚úÖ Bitrate Adaptation: Utilizes Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding as compression control technique applied during recording process, objective maintains consistent perceptual video quality while minimizing overall file size, VBR encoder dynamically adjusts output bitrate (kilobits per second) in real-time, allocates more data to visually complex frames/segments (high motion, detailed textures, rapid scene changes), reduces bitrate during simpler segments (static shots, periods of silence), AVCHD typically operates using Constrained VBR (CVBR) allowing bitrate fluctuation within specified minimum/maximum range (e.g., up to 28 Mbps for high-end AVCHD Progressive), dynamic allocation ensures quality preserved where visual complexity demands it, distinct from Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR) which is delivery mechanism for internet streaming

#### **17. MTS Container Handling** ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**
- **Q101**: ‚úÖ MTS vs M2TS: No functional difference between .MTS and .m2ts extensions, both refer to same underlying high-definition container format (MPEG Transport Stream encapsulated under AVCHD standard), files are stream-identical and can be renamed interchangeably without affecting playback/decoding capability, .MTS universally used by AVCHD camcorders for raw footage files created during recording process, .m2ts commonly adopted when stream file imported to computer using proprietary software or when file is part of fully authored Blu-ray Disc structure adhering to BDAV convention, naming difference is artifact of media access/handling after capture
- **Q102**: ‚úÖ MTS Indexing/Seeking: AVCHD relies on crucial external index file Clip Information (.CPI) associated one-to-one with corresponding .MTS stream file, complexity of seeking in H.264 stream (P-frames/B-frames referencing I-frames) necessitates external index for efficiency, .CPI file stores Entry Point Map (EPM) explicitly mapping Presentation Time Stamps (PTS) to physical offsets within .MTS file where crucial I-frames are located, seeking process: consult .CPI file ‚Üí use EPM to identify closest preceding I-frame offset ‚Üí perform direct file system seek to physical byte offset ‚Üí begin decoding at I-frame and process subsequent P/B-frames until target PTS reached, external indexing explains challenges when raw .MTS files manually copied without accompanying .CPI metadata
- **Q103**: ‚úÖ Transport Stream Structure: .MTS container is MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS) specified by ISO/IEC 13818-1, fundamental digital container designed for transmission/storage of audio/video/data over channels prone to error/data loss (broadcasting/continuous recording onto consumer flash media), packet-based structure with fixed-size 188-byte packets, each packet contains header, specific Packet Identifier (PID), and payload data from Elementary Streams (H.264 video stream, Dolby AC-3 audio stream), integrity maintained by mandatory error correction codes and synchronization pattern, Program Specific Information (PSI) includes Program Map Table (PMT) mapping PIDs to specific data types, synchronization ensured by periodic Program Clock References (PCRs)
- **Q104**: ‚úÖ Multiple Audio Tracks: MPEG Transport Stream container inherently supports multiple audio tracks/elementary streams simultaneously, each identified by unique Packet Identifier (PID) specified in PMT, AVCHD supports various audio formats (Dolby Digital AC-3, Linear PCM), common complication when camcorder records multi-channel audio (5.1 AC-3) using multiple PIDs for discrete channel data, compliant playback devices correctly read PMT to interpret PIDs as channels belonging to single multi-channel program, some NLE software may fail to correctly interpret structure, incorrectly importing each channel stream as independent separate track instead of consolidating into one multi-channel track, issue is software failure to comply with MPEG-TS protocol, not AVCHD container limitation
- **Q105**: ‚úÖ Chapter Navigation: Chapter navigation and logical playback sequence definition handled by Playlist (.MPL) files in \BDMV\PLAYLIST directory, .MPL file defines logical video sequence by referencing one or more physical clips (.MTS files), allows continuous playback even if segments recorded as multiple fragmented files on storage medium, binary structure of .MPL file contains specific marker data (user-defined or automatic scene change markers) corresponding to precise Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) values within referenced .MTS streams, markers function as official chapter start points, AVCHD playback device uses two-tiered navigation system: .MPL file provides high-level human-readable menu and chapter list, associated .CPI file translates selected chapter's timecode marker into necessary low-level physical offset for rapid seeking in .MTS file, logical organization (editing, chapters) implemented without physically altering original recorded media stream data
